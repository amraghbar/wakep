          <h4> You’d be forgiven for thinking that the first Apple logo represents a different company. It’s not the smooth, sleek design we’re familiar with today. In fact, it looks like something you’d expect to see slapped on a bottle of craft bee

                  </div> 
                             <h4>
 The job of creating the company’s first logo fell to Ronald Wayne, who decided to use Isaac Newton’s image sitting below a tree – the same Isaac Newton who discovered gravity when an apple fell out of a tree onto his head.
As we know, Ronald Wayne didn’t last long at Apple, and neither did his logo.

                      <h1> 1977</h1>
          <h4> After only a year, Steve Jobs announced the logo as “old-fashioned” and thought it was too challenging to use on a smaller scale. Jobs also believed in the importance of modern computer design and wanted a logo to reinforce this idea and impress customers.
After all, a logo represents what a brand is. An old-style logo will cause people to think your brand is outdated, too.

                 <div style="padding-left: 50%"><img src="New folder/apple_logo_1977.png" width="452" height="218"  /></div> 
                             <h4> 
 To help create a new logo, Jobs hired Rob Janoff, a graphic designer tasked with creating a logo that would blend the name “Apple” with a modern-looking design.

And so, the famous Apple logo was born. Janoff’s design was quite simple, a 2D apple with a bite taken out of it and a rainbow spectrum splashed across it. The bite mark was included so people wouldn’t confuse it with a cherry. And, it’s also a geeky play on words (“byte” is a computer term).

          <h4> From here, the logo went through small but meaningful iterations. The same year the Macintosh was launch, Landor Associates removed the company’s name from the logo—turning it into the icon that would become, well, iconic for decades to come.

                      <h1> 1998</h1>
          <h4> Steve Jobs left Apple in 1985 after being pushed out by the company’s executives, but he returned in 1997, as the company was losing money at a rapid pace and faced the very real threat of going bust. 
In addition to revamping the company’s entire brand image, one of his big challenges was rebooting the logo; it was a universally recognized symbol and needed to be leveraged if the company was to survive.   
           </h4>
                 <div style="padding-left: 50%"><img src="New folder/apple_logo_1988.png" width="293" height="220"  /></div> 
                             <h4> 
 He removed the rainbow colors and replaced it with solid black, to complement the creation of their new, sleek, silver computer models. This new logo would be used on their latest ground-breaking product, the iMac, and would set the scene for a triumphant return.

Today Apple fully embraces flat, minimalist logo design with a logo that comes in 3 colors: White, black, and silver. It’s a simple-yet-powerful logo, which perfectly resonates with the Apple brand.

It’s one of the easiest symbols to recognize in the world, along with the likes of McDonald’s golden arches, and Nike’s swoosh.
